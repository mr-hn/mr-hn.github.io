      <description>Data is propelling innovation and competitiveness the way oil and assembly line have done in the past. My aspiration is to leverage analytics to enable data-driven decision making in businesses. I am a proactive problem solver with extensive experience working on descriptive and predictive analytics to build strategies that maximize impact.
I began my career as an SAP consultant, developing enterprise applications for customers across industries and geographies. I bring with me experience working across teams and time zones in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.</description>
